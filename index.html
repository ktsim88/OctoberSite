                  Agatha Christie was born on Septermber 15, 1890 in Torquay,
                  Devon England. When she was younger, she loved to make stories
                  as a child. She taught herself how to read and write. She
                  married Archie Christie but they got into a fight. In 1928,
                  they divorced and she married Max Mallowman in 1930. She
                  always traveled with him to the Middle East which is why many
                  of her stories are in that area.
